# This script downloads, patches, and builds a version of Unicorn with
# minor tweaks to allow Unicorn-emulated binaries to be run under
# afl-fuzz. 
#
# The modifications reside in patches/*. The standalone Unicorn library
# will be written to /usr/lib/libunicornafl.so, and the Python bindings
# will be installed system-wide.
#
# You must make sure that Unicorn Engine is not already installed before
# running this script. If it is, please uninstall it first.
